## What You'll Need:
- A computer with internet

## Step 1: Get Your App Code (5 minutes)

### From Replit:
1. In your Replit project, click the three dots menu (â‹¯) 
2. Click "Download as zip"
3. Save the file to your Downloads folder
4. Unzip/extract the folder

---

## Step 2: Create Free Accounts (5 minutes)

### GitHub Account:
1. Go to github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use your email and create a password
4. Verify your email

### Vercel Account:
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub" (easier!)
4. This connects both accounts automatically

## Step 3: Put Your Code on GitHub (5 minutes)

1. In GitHub, click the green "New" button
2. Repository name: `maclap-cash-app`
3. Make it "Private" (only you can see it)
4. Click "Create repository"

5. Click "uploading an existing file"
6. Drag your unzipped MacLap folder into the browser
7. Wait for upload to finish

## Step 5: Set Up Your Database (5 minutes)

Your app needs Firebase (free database). In Vercel:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables (I'll give you the exact values):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain_here
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_here
```

**Note**: I'll help you get these Firebase values - it's just copy/paste!

## Step 6: Test Your App (2 minutes)

1. Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://maclap-cash-app.vercel.app`
2. Click the link
3. Try logging in as Puneet or Sonu
4. Add a test transaction

**If it works**: Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
**If it doesn't**: Don't worry, I'll help you fix it.

Your app will work exactly the same as it does now on Replit, but you'll own it completely!
