# Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue Summary
Your deployment is failing because it's configured as "static" but this is a full-stack Express.js application that needs server deployment.

## The Fix

You need to manually update your `.replit` file:

**Current configuration:**
```
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "static"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
publicDir = "dist"
```

**Change to:**
```
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["node", "build.js"]
run = ["npm", "start"]
```

## Why This Works

- **autoscale**: Runs your Express.js server instead of serving static files
- **node build.js**: Uses the custom build script that properly organizes files
- **npm start**: Starts your production server after build

## Quick Steps

1. Open `.replit` file in the editor
2. Replace the `[deployment]` section with the new configuration above
3. Save and deploy

The build script is already configured and will handle moving files to the correct structure for deployment.
